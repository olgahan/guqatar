## Goals
- Find out whether data **automatically** tells us what is true or not
- Identify **patterns** in data and describe what they show
- Distinguish **descriptive, predictive, and causal** claims
- Ask better questions when someone makes a **data-based claim**

## Why statistical reasoning matters?
- **Intellectual skill:** Reason carefully about patterns in human behavior
- **Academia:** Read, interpret, and contribute to social science research
- **Policy:** Evaluate evidence behind decisions that affect society
- **Private sector & life:** Use data responsibly to anticipate outcomes


## "According to data..."
### Does data speak?

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Common claims: 
  - "The **data says** X causes Y"
  - "**According to data**, A is better than B"
- Implied: data reveals objective truth
- Reality: data **requires interpretation**

## Variables

- Characteristics that vary

![](s2.png){width=100%}


## Types of Variables

- Nominal/categorical: **Cannot be ordered** 
  - Region
- Ordinal: **Ordered**
  - Very liberal < Liberal < Moderate < Conservative < Very conservative
-Numerical: Ordered + **equidistant**
  - Age, GDP, number of casualties


## Practice
### Varieties of Democracy’s regime type measure:

- 0: Closed autocracy – No multiparty elections
- 1: Electoral autocracy – De-jure elections but not free and fair
- 2: Electoral democracy – Free and fair elections with some flaws
- 3: Liberal democracy – Free and fair elections guaranteed

## Descriptive Statistics
### Summarizing Patterns: Categorical data


::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Counts / frequencies: How many observations fall in each category.
- Percentages / proportions: Useful to compare groups.
- Mode: The most common category

## Descriptive Statistics
### Summarizing Patterns: Numerical data


::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}


- Measures of central tendency:
  - Mean (average): Add values, divide by count
  - Median: Middle value when ordered
  - Mode: Most common value
- Measures of spread / variability:
  - Range: Difference between max and min
  - Standard deviation

## Predictive Reasoning
### Can we forecast outcomes?


::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}



- Use patterns to **predict an outcome**
- Example: **Next election**, would we expect a high or low turnout at a **university town?**
- What if we want to know <span style="color:#8B0000;">**why?**</span>

## Causal Inference
### Does X cause Y?


::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}



- X: Independent variable
- Y: Dependent variable
- Causal claims are everywhere
- The ultimate question: 
  - **does changing X change Y**

## Do democracy promotion programs reduce protests?

![](s6.png){style="width:40%; max-height:200px; display:block; margin:auto;"}

- Average protests if received program: (2+1+3)/3 = 2 →  <span style="color:#000080;">**fewer protests**</span> 
- Average protests if no program: (5+4+6)/3 = 5 →  <span style="color:#8B0000;">**more protests**</span> 
- what if we knew **both worlds?**


## Counterfactuals
### What would Y be if X did not change/take place?

- If Trump did not win 2024 elections, would Maduro still be in power? 
- If it wasn’t for Qatar, would **Messi ever win the World Cup?**
- 
- 


## Potential Outcomes & Counterfactuals


![](s7.png){style="width:50%; max-height:200px; display:block; margin:auto;"}

- Going back to the example, **we do not know the counterfactuals**. 
- But **let's assume** we do know them...

## Potential Outcomes & Counterfactuals


![](s8.png){style="width:50%; max-height:200px; display:block; margin:auto;"}


- Average effect for countries that received program: (2+1+0)/3 = 1
- Average effect for countries that did not receive program: (1+1+1)/3 = 1


## Causal Inference
### Does a change in X cause a change in Y?

- Patterns alone are not enough
  - Observations that are treated and not treated tend to be **systematically different:** <span style="color:#8B0000;">**Selection bias**</span> 
- Without counterfactuals, it is difficult to make causal claims

**Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference: We never observe the counterfactual**

## 

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; height:100%;">
  <h1 style="font-size:3em; text-align:center;">
    <span style="color:#000080;">**Good news:**</span> <span style="color:#8B0000;">**we can predict them**</span> 
  </h1>
</div>

  </h1>
</div>
**Causal inference = imputing the counterfactual and estimating the effect**

## Imputing the counterfactual

- Qualitatively
  - Case studies
- Quantitatively
  - Experiments
  - Observational studies
  
  

## Experiments
### Gold standard


- **Random assignment** ensures no selection bias
- Isolate the effect of X on Y

## Let's think about this intuitively
### An example from a field experiment in Pakistan (Cheema et al. 2022)


- How can we close persistent gender gaps in political participation?
   - Male household members as **“gatekeepers” of women’s participation**
- Targeting women -> no effect
- **Targeting male household members** -> increase in women’s turnout

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}



- When you assign a household to treated, **you are realizing the household’s potential outcome under treatment**

- When you assign a household to control, **you are realizing the household’s potential outcome under control**

<!-- ## Experiments -->
<!-- ### Limitations -->

<!-- - Why not run experiments for everything? -->
<!--   - Practicality  -->
<!--   - Feasibility -->
<!--   - Ethical considerations  -->

## Experiments
### Limitations

- Why not run experiments for everything?
  - **Practical constraints**
    - Cost, time, scale
  - **Feasibility**
    - Cannot randomly assign many social conditions
  - **Ethical considerations**
    - Harm, consent, fairness

## Observational Designs
### When we cannot run experiments

- Many social questions **cannot be randomized**
  - Democracy, migration, welfare, education
- Policies are **not supposed to be not assigned at random**
  - Welfare is not given to the rich
- This creates **selection bias**


<!-- ## Observational designs -->
<!-- ### When we can not run experiments -->

<!-- - Many social questions can not be randomized -->
<!--   - Examples? -->
<!-- - Most interesting questions/policies tend to favor selection -->
<!--   - Why give welfare to rich? -->
<!-- - Luckily, there are design-based approaches -->

<!-- ## Matching -->
<!-- ### Comparing similar units -->

<!-- - Do UN peacekeeping missions reduce civilian deaths? -->
<!-- - Naive comparison can mislead: Peacekeepers might more likely to be sent to more severe conflicts. -->
<!-- - Compare only those with similar conflict intensity. -->

<!-- ## Discontinuity designs -->
<!-- ### Compare units around a threshold -->

<!-- - Thresholds allow for natural divergence:  -->
<!--   - Elections -->
<!--   - Welfare programs -->

<!-- - Example: How does tutoring affect student performance? -->

<!--   - Selection bias: Students who do and do not receive tutoring might be systematically different -->

<!-- - Discontinuity: Students who score 70 or below are automatically enrolled in a free tutoring program and receive assistance throughout the year. -->

## Matching
### Comparing similar units

- **Idea:** Compare units that are **similar in important ways**, except for whether they received the treatment
  <!-- - This helps reduce unfair comparisons -->

- **Example:** Do UN peacekeeping missions reduce civilian deaths?
  - Problem: Peacekeepers are sent to more violent conflicts
  - Solution: Compare conflicts with **similar violence levels**
    - Some with peacekeepers | some without
    
    
## Discontinuity Designs
### Comparing units near a cutoff

- Some policies use **clear rules or thresholds**
  - Elections, Welfare programs
- Example: **Does tutoring improve student performance?**

- Problem: Students who do and do not get tutoring may already be different

- Policy: Students scoring **70 or below** get tutoring
  - Compare students **just below and just above 70**


## Discontinuity designs
### Compare units around a threshold

<!-- ## Difference in Differences -->
<!-- ### Compare units that follow similar trends the treatment -->

<!-- - How do sanctions affect human rights violations? -->
<!-- - Two countries:  -->
<!--   - One sanctioned (treated) -->
<!--   - One not sanctioned (control) -->
<!-- - The dif-in-dif can be attributed to intervention if -->
<!--   - They follow parallel trends before the intervention -->

## Difference in Differences
### Comparing changes over time

- **Idea:**
  - Compare how outcomes **change over time** between a treated group and a similar control group
  - Focus on differences in **trends**, not levels

## Difference in Differences
### Comparing changes over time

- **Example:** How do sanctions affect human rights violations?
  - Two countries:
    - One sanctioned (treated)
    - One not sanctioned (control)
  - Key assumption:
    - Both countries followed **similar trends before** sanctions

## Other designs for observational data

- Instrumental variable
- Synthetic control
- Shared goal: **imputing the counterfactual using appropriate the design**


## Takeaways
### Why statistics matters

- Data don’t speak for themselves: they are produced, measured, and **interpreted by humans.**
- Statistical reasoning is **powerful:** bad data, poor comparisons, or **naive interpretation can mislead.**


## Takeaways
### Why learn?

- **Policy relevance:** make sense of interventions and their consequences.
- **Social science literacy:** read and critique academic research confidently.
- **Real-world decision-making:** informed skepticism is a marketable skill anywhere data are used.
